I present a short program written by me in Python which is useful in my daily work.

It is an ordinary working day, a group of testers with the following names: 
- Adamina, 
- Makryna, 
- Lukrecja, 
- Eustazy, 
- Gniwko, 
- Zygfryd 
they heaving a task - Manual Tests on an environment called the *COMPANY_2*, but they cannot quickly decide who will choose which environment...

 With the help is coming the **Drawing Machine** which will quickly resolve this situation and bring a random factor in the selection.
