# Lottery Machine "losomat"
I present a short program written by me in Python which is useful in my daily work.

## Example of use
It is an ordinary working day, a group of testers with the following names: 
- Adamina, 
- Makryna, 
- Lukrecja, 
- Eustazy, 
- Gniwko, 
- Zygfryd 
  
they heaving a task - Manual Tests on an environment called the *COMPANY_2*, but they cannot quickly decide who will choose which environment...

 With the help is coming the **Lottery Machine** which will quickly resolve this situation and bring a random factor in the selection.

## Description
After starting the program, a welcome message for the defined employees is displayed. The program was written for **6 people**, the iteration runs along the length of the name table.

The program offers a choice:
- **COMPANY_1** This is an example of a company for which there is a 6 test environment. After full iteration, the program ends (Picture_1)
- **COMPANY_2** 
This is an example of a company for which there is an 8 test environment. After full iteration, the program ends with information about which environments have not been selected for the given employees (Picture_2)
- **NEW ENVIRONMENT** It is also possible to enter your own names fot the New Environments.
 *So if you enter fewer new names than 6, the program makes a lottery for as many names as given environment names and ends with an error* (Picture_3)
