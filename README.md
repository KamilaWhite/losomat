# Lottery Machine "losomat"
I present a short program written by me in Python which is useful in my daily work.

## Example of use
It is an ordinary working day, a group of testers with the following names: 
- Adamina, 
- Makryna, 
- Lukrecja, 
- Eustazy, 
- Gniwko, 
- Zygfryd 
  
they heaving a task - Manual Tests on an environment called the *COMPANY_2*, but they cannot quickly decide who will choose which environment...

 With the help is coming the **Lottery Machine** which will quickly resolve this situation and bring a random factor in the selection.

*Result*

## Description
 The program offers a choice of two defined environments named *COMPANY_1* and *COMPANY_2*, for which we can iterate. 
 It is also possible to enter your own names for the *NEW ENVIRONMENT*. 
 The program was written for *6 people*, the iteration runs along the length of the name table, so if you enter fewer new names than 6, the program ends with an error.

 *Result of error*

  **I will present the program upgrade soon.**
